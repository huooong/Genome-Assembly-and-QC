## EXTRA (for the group):
You can make the scripts executable. This is done by executing the following code before running a script for the first time:
```bash
chmod +x file_name.sh
````
Replace `file_name.sh` with the specific script. 

To run the script.
```bash
./file_name.sh
```

If you want to modify the permissions of a file or directory:
```bash
chmod [mode] [File_name]
```
If you set mode to 744 => You edit & run; others can read (not execute).
